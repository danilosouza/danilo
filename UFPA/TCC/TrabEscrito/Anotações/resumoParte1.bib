abstract = {"An interactive algorithm for soft segmentation of natural images is presented in this paper. The user first roughly scribbles different regions of interest, and from them, the whole image is automatically segmented. This soft segmentation is obtained via fast, linear complexity computation of weighted distances to the user-provided scribbles. The adaptive weights are obtained from a series of Gabor filters, and are automatically computed according to the ability of each single filter to discriminate between the selected regions of interest. We present the underlying framework and examples showing the capability of the algorithm to segment diverse images."},
