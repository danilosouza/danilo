abstract = {This paper describes a computational approach to edge detection. The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge.},

abstract = {This paper, we will review the main approaches of partitioning an image into regions by using gray values in order to reach a correct interpretation of the image. We mainly compare the region-based segmentation with the boundary estimation using edge detection. Image segmentation is an important step for many image processing and computer vision algorithms while an edge can be described informally as the boundary between adjacent parts of an image. A formal definition is elusive, but edge detection is nonetheless a useful and ubiquitous image processing task. After comparing we have come to a conclusion that the edge detection has advantage of not necessarily needing closed boundaries and also its computation is based on difference. The region-segmentation in spite of improving multi-spectral images has the drawback of being applied only on closed boundaries. To reach the result of edge detection we have used the technique of performance metrics and Canny edge detection. We have applied Canny ground truth to acquire more features via displaying more details.},

This paper proves that the objective function of Otsu method is equivalent to that of K-means method in multilevel thresholding . They are both based on a same criterion that minimizes the within-class variance. However, Otsu method is an exhaustive algorithm of searching the global optimal threshold, while K-means is a local optimal method. Moreover, K-means does not require computing a gray-level histogram before running, but Otsu method needs to compute a gray-level histogram firstly. Therefore, K-means can be more efficiently extended to multilevel thresholding method, two-dimensional thresholding method and three-dimensional method than Otsu method. This paper proved that the clustering results of K-means keep the order of the initial centroids with respect to one-dimensional data set. The experiments show that the k-means thresholding method performs well with less computing time than Otsu method does on three dimensional image thresholding.},

abstract = {A framework for robust foreground detection that works under difficult conditions such as dynamic background and moderately moving camera is presented in this paper. The proposed method includes two main components: coarse scene representation as the union of pixel layers, and foreground detection in video by propagating these layers using a maximum-likelihood assignment. We first cluster into "layers" those pixels that share similar statistics. The entire scene is then modeled as the union of such non-parametric layer-models. An in-coming pixel is detected as foreground if it does not adhere to these adaptive models of the background. A principled way of computing thresholds is used to achieve robust detection performance with a pre-specified number of false alarms. Correlation between pixels in the spatial vicinity is exploited to deal with camera motion without precise registration or optical flow. The proposed technique adapts to changes in the scene, and allows to automatically convert persistent foreground objects to background and re-convert them to foreground when they become interesting. This simple framework addresses the important problem of robust foreground and unusual region detection, at about 10 frames per second on a standard laptop computer. The presentation of the proposed approach is complemented by results on challenging real data and comparisons with other standard techniques.},

First, visual sensor networks are assumed to contain tens to hundreds of cameras- many more than are considered in many vision applications. Second, these cameras are likely to be spread over a wide geographical area- much larger than the typical computer lab.

abstract = {Several general-purpose algorithms and techniques have been developed for image segmentation. Since there is no general solution to the image segmentation problem, these techniques often have to be combined with domain knowledge in order to effectively solve an image segmentation problem for a problem domain. This paper presents a comparative study of the basic image segmentation techniques i.e. edge-based, k-means clustering, thresholding and region-based techniques, using a number of test images. The objects extracted after image enhancement and image segmentation as compared to the objects desired, whether the region boundaries are closed or disconnected and the mean weighted distance measure of the segmented objects with respect to the original image form the criteria to perform the comparative study. Image segmentation is further used for object matching between two images. Correlation between the objects being matched in the two images is used as a measure of similarity between the two objects. The first principal component axis, determined by principal component analysis (PCA), of the objects being matched are aligned with the x-axis to take into account the different orientation of an object in different images.},

abstract = {Colorization, the task of coloring a grayscale image or video, involves assigning from the single dimension of intensity or luminance a quantity that varies in three dimensions, such as red, green, and blue channels. Mapping between intensity and color is, therefore, not unique, and colorization is ambiguous in nature and requires some amount of human interaction or external information. A computationally simple, yet effective, approach of colorization is presented in this paper. The method is fast and it can be conveniently used "on the fly," permitting the user to interactively get the desired results promptly after providing a reduced set of chrominance scribbles. Based on the concepts of luminance-weighted chrominance blending and fast intrinsic distance computations, high-quality colorization results for still images and video are obtained at a fraction of the complexity and computational cost of previously reported techniques. Possible extensions of the algorithm introduced here included the capability of changing the colors of an existing color image or video, as well as changing the underlying luminance, and many other special effects demonstrated here.},

@article{Yi2012,
abstract = {As a preprocessing step, image segmentation, which can do partition of an image into different regions, plays an important role in computer vision, objects recognition, tracking and image analysis. Till today, there are a large number of methods present that can extract the required foreground from the background. However, most of these methods are solely based on boundary or regional information which has limited the segmentation result to a large extent. Since the graph cut based segmentation method was proposed, it has obtained a lot of attention because this method utilizes both boundary and regional information. Furthermore, graph cut based method is efficient and accepted world-wide since it can achieve globally optimal result for the energy function. It is not only promising to specific image with known information but also effective to the natural image without any pre-known information. For the segmentation of N-dimensional image, graph cut based methods are also applicable. Due to the advantages of graph cut, various methods have been proposed. In this paper, the main aim is to help researcher to easily understand the graph cut based segmentation approach. We also classify this method into three categories. They are speed up-based graph cut, interactive-based graph cut and shape prior-based graph cut. This paper will be helpful to those who want to apply graph cut method into their research.},

abstract = {This paper studies different methods proposed so far for segmentation evaluation. Most methods can be classified into three groups: the analytical, the empirical goodness and the empirical discrepancy groups. Each group has its own characteristics. After a brief description of each method in every group, some comparative discussions about different method groups are first carried out. An experimental comparison for some empirical (goodness and discrepancy) methods commonly used is then performed to provide a rank of their evaluation abilities. In addition, some special methods are also discussed. This study is helpful for an appropriate use of existing evaluation methods and for improving their performance as well as for systematically designing new evalution methods.},

abstract = {An up-to-date review of the progress in the evaluation of image segmentation, since the first survey on this subject published by Zhang (1996), is presented. The analysis and comparison of these evaluation methods are performed according to the classification and assessment criteria for methods and performance metrics proposed in that survey. The results reveal the advantages and limitation of these new methods, and provide additional understanding about the evaluation procedure. This review presents also some novel procedures for image generation under different conditions. Compared to the results of that survey, it seems that though more attention has been attracted and more results have been obtained in these years, however, new efforts and ideas for the methodology and practical evaluation implementation are still needed},
