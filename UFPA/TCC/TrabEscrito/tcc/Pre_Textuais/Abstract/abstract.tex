Image segmentation is about splitting an image into objects and/or regions with characteristics in common, such as color, texture and geometry aiming to ease the analysis of the regions of interest within the given image. The growth of mobile devices over the past years, increasing the amount of multimedia content produced, has opened the need for more robust and better quality image segmentation algorithms. Implementing a semi-automatic image segmentation technique that relies on color and distance informations of a pixel to classify it accordingly to user defined regions, this work's aims to improve execution time spent to calculate the distante from all the pixels in the image to the pixels inside the regions of interest. By adding one more step in order to reduce the search space of the distance calculation step, so it is no longer necessary to calculate the distance to all the pixels inside the scribbles. The evaluations were performed based on execution time and classification errors, having the algorithm presented positive results after the modifications were applied.
